# domain-classification-based-on-linkedin-summary
The spectrum of job titles or positions for working professionals keeps increasing on a daily basis. Many organizations describe more or less the same responsibilities disparately. The social media of working professionals, LinkedIn can be used
to go through such extensive individual summaries. LinkedIn
is home to many job seekers and employers alike. LinkedIn
summaries act as the first interaction between the applicant
and employer. Furthermore, the app also uses the same along
with many other parameters to suggest job openings. But, many
times, due to some specific keywords in the summaries, the job
search also narrows down, excluding many potentially positive
job openings for the user.

We aim to read LinkedIn summaries of users to
generalize their work domain to better suggest job openings and
also be useful for further analysis.
